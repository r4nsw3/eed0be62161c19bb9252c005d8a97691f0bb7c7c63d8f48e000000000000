  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore a massive world with unique islands and landscapes. Discuss   |
  |   rumors and discover the origins of each island by talking to the      |
  |   people that live there.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Expect the unexpected when at sea. Events you may be unprepared for   |
  |   may occur such as a foodborne illness among your crew. You'll need    |
  |   to have access to the right supplies and have the experience to       |
  |   keep your ship afloat.                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A casual but real challenge - While simple to pickup and              |
  |   understand, there are numerous events that only an experienced        |
  |   swashbuckler will be prepared for. This makes the game more           |
  |   satisfying for long term pirates.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Thoughtfully executed cutscenes that help to bring the world to       |
  |   life as well as reward pirates that explore.                          |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Sailing between islands is necessary to expand your control over      |
  |   the world and to increase your reputation.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Tending to the morale, hunger, and thirst of your crew will require   |
  |   you to maintain a supply of food/water and consider whether or not    |
  |   rationing food is required during long journeys.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Governing islands you've conquered is a difficult responsibility as   |
  |   you will need to solve economic issues before they get out of hand.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Purchase larger ships as you fight your way through the sea.          |
  |   Famously powerful vessels such as the Galleon and Man of War are      |
  |   but a few of the available ships.                                     |
